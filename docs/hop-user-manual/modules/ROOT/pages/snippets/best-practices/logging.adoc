[[Logging]]
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

Take some time to capture the logging of your workflows and pipelines, so you can easily find a trace of anything you have run.

Things tend to go wrong when you least expect it and at that point you like being able to see what happened.

See xref:logging/logging-basics.adoc[Logging Basics], xref:logging/logging-reflection.adoc[Logging Reflection] or consider logging to a xref:technology/neo4j/index.adoc[Neo4j] graph database.
This last one allows you to browse the logging results in the Neo4j perspective.

Other options include the xref:metadata-types/pipeline-log.adoc[Pipeline Log], xref:metadata-types/pipeline-probe.adoc[Pipeline Probe], xref:metadata-types/workflow-log.adoc[Workflow log] and xref:metadata-types/execution-information-location.adoc[Execution Information Location]. Take a look at the available options and choose a logging strategy that works for your project and team.

= Start

== Description

The `Start` action is a special action, as it is the starting point for all workflow executions.

NOTE: Every workflow needs to have one and only one start action.

WARNING: The start action has additional options to repeat a workflow. This works in both the local and remote workflow engine, but is mainly available for historical reasons and shouldn't be considered as an alternative to `cron`, Apache Airflow or any other type of scheduling.

When you activate the repeat option the workflow will continue to run and restart based on the interval you specify. This can be on a fixed day with a specific timestamp. Or every x seconds/minutes

While this does not replace a scheduler it can be used for basic scheduling. Please note that using this will keep the workflow in a running state meaning the Java process will continue to exist and use resources on the system.

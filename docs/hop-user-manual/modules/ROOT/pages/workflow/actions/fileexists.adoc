:description: The File Exists action verifies that a specified file exists on the server on which Hop is running.

= File Exists

== Description

The `File exists` action verifies that a specified file exists and can be reached from the machine on which Apache Hop is running.

You must provide the file name.

Hop returns a True or False value depending on whether the file exists.

The File Exists action can be an easy integration point with other systems.

For example, suppose you have a three-part data warehouse load process.

The first part runs in PERL.

You have batch scripts that accesses data from a remote location, performs first-level row processing, and outputs the data to a specified directory.

You do not want to start the workflow until this is done, so you put the workflow on a scheduler.

As soon as the task is complete, the file is placed in a well-known location so that the "file exists." That is the signal that launches the workflow for final processing.

== Description

The Metadata perspective is where you manage the different xref:metadata-types/index.adoc[metadata types] available in your Hop projects.

=== Managing elements

You can right-click on any element to edit, rename, duplicate or delete an element.  You can also use this menu to create new elements.
To create a new element you can also double-click on the element type itself.
You can also use the toolbar icons in the toolbar located right above the metadata tree.

=== Tabs

When creating or editing metadata elements you will get the information presented in a separate tab on the right-hand side.  This will allow you to easily switch between various metadata elements when working in a project.

== Description

Apache Doris is a modern MPP analytical database product. It can provide sub-second queries and efficient real-time data analysis. With it's distributed architecture, up to 10PB level datasets will be well supported and easy to operate.

Apache Doris can meet various data analysis demands, including history data reports, real-time data analysis, interactive data analysis, and exploratory data analysis. Make your data analysis easier!

The Doris Bulk Loader allows you to insert data into Apache Doris at high speed and volume, making it a faster way to load data than using the traditional database insert statements.

== Description

The Execution Information transform allows you to read (or delete) information from an xref:metadata-types/execution-information-location.adoc[Execution Information Location].
Depending on which operation you select, different input options will be enabled.
The output of the transform will be different as well.
This means that this transform always needs input-rows in order to produce output.

**Example to delete 200 Execution Idâ€™s:**
First use Generate rows to create your fields and values to use (children: Boolean = true) and (limit: Integer = 200). Then use a first transform to get the ids (Operation: Get execution IDs), and a second connected transform to delete them (Operation: Delete execution). Optionally you can also delete by other fields such as date and ID. It can take a while to query the Execution Information, so keep an eye on the Duration column.

== Options

Here are the important options to fill in to get the transform to work:

* Event Hubs namespace: the name of your Event Hubs namespace
* Event Hubs instance name: the name of the Event Hub, the instance itself.
* SAS Policy key name: the name of the policy in the "Shared Access Policies" section of the Event Hubs Namespace in the Azure dashboard.
This needs to be a policy with the "Send" claim enabled.
* SAS Key connection string: You can use the value in the policy labeled "Connection stringâ€“primary key"
* Batch size: the number of messages (events) to send in one batch with each call to Azure.
* Message field: the field containing the message to use as the events.
Please note you can use a transform like JSON Output or "Java Script" to assemble the message.

:description: This page describes how Hop supports the Avro data type.

= Avro

From https://avro.apache.org[avro.apache.org]:

Apache Avroâ„¢ is a data serialization system. To learn more about Avro, please read the https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/[current documentation].

Hop supports Avro through a number of plugins.
First and foremost we support Avro as a data type called "Avro Record".  It simply describes a class of type `org.apache.avro.generic.GenericRecord`.  This in turn encapsulates both an Avro schema and a set of values.

== Pipeline Transforms

* xref:pipeline/transforms/avro-decode.adoc[Avro Decode]: This allows you to extract Hop values from an Avro Record data type.
* xref:pipeline/transforms/avro-encode.adoc[Avro Encode]: This allows you to extract Hop values from an Avro Record data type.

== Kafka Producer transforms

If you want to send or receive Avro records using the Hop Kafka transforms it's important to set a few options:

|===
|Option |Description |Example


|`value.converter.schema.registry.url`
|Specify the URL of your Confluent schema registry.
|http://confluent-server:8081

|`schema.registry.url`
|Specify the URL of your Confluent schema registry.
|http://confluent-server:8081

|`auto.register.schemas`
|Instruct Kafka to automatically register the schema of the Avro record in the Confluent schema registry.
|true

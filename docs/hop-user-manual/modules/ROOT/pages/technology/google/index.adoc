:description: The Google platform is supported in Hop through a number of (Beam) transforms and Apache VFS support for Google Drive and Google Cloud Storage. Additionally, a number of external transform plugins are available.

== Introduction

The Google technology stack is supported in Hop through a number of plugins.
We briefly touch upon them below.

== Pipeline Transforms

* xref:pipeline/transforms/beambigqueryinput.adoc[BigQuery Input (Beam)]
* xref:pipeline/transforms/beambigqueryoutput.adoc[BigQuery Output (Beam)]
* xref:pipeline/transforms/beambigtableinput.adoc[Bigtable Input (Beam)]
* xref:pipeline/transforms/beambigtableinput.adoc[Bigtable Output (Beam)]
* xref:pipeline/transforms/beamgcppublisher.adoc[GCP Pub/Sub Publisher (Beam)]
* xref:pipeline/transforms/beamgcpsubscriber.adoc[GCP Pub/Sub Subscriber (Beam)]

== VFS

Apache xref:vfs.adoc[VFS Support] in Hop allows you to directly read from a multitude of file systems and protocols, including Google:

* xref:vfs/google-drive-vfs.adoc[Google Drive]: read and write data directly from and to Google Drive files and folders.
* xref:vfs/google-cloud-storage-vfs.adoc[Google Cloud Storage]: read and write data directly from and to files and folders in Google Cloud Storage buckets

== Beam vs Google Cloud

When executing your pipeline using a Beam runner which is NOT DataFlow, make sure to pass the default Google cloud project ID by running:

`gcloud config set project <project-id>`

This affects Google Cloud specific APIs like BigQuery, Pub/Sub and others.

:description: This describes the usage of a pipeline to resolve variable expressions

== Functionality

We can create a new variable resolver metadata element of type `Pipeline Variable Resolver`.
The options used are fairly simple:

* The pipeline filename to use: The file name of the pipeline to run to resolve a variable expression.
* Pipeline Run configuration name: this has to reference a run configuration of type: xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/native-local-pipeline-engine.adoc[Native Local].
* The name of the variable in the pipeline that will contain the expression to resolve
* The name of the output field to use to pick up the value of the fields.

This setup gives you a lot of flexibility.  Maybe you have a configuration file per database, per system, ...
In that case you can set the variable to contain the type or name of the database, system, ... to read a configuration file for.
You can retrieve multiple values from these alternative configuration stores and send them to the output transform in a single row.

IMPORTANT: Only the first output row in the pipeline is considered.

The variable expression is (as always) in the following format:

`{openvar}name:variable:field{closevar}`

* name: the name of the variable resolver metadata element to use
* variable: the variable value to set in the variable specified in the metadata (see above)
* field: the name of the field for which we want to retrieve a string in the output transform.

== Example

Suppose we have a number of databases we have configuration files for in separate properties files:

* db1.properties
* db2.properties
* db3.properties
...

These all contain the same 5 keys, with different values of-course:

[source,properties]
----
username=user1
password=pwd1
hostname=hostname1
port=port1
db=db1
----

We can then have a pipeline that reads and processes the appropriate file per type:

image::metadata-types/variable-resolver/pipeline-variable-resolver-pipeline.png[]

The Variable Resolver metadata would look like this:

image::metadata-types/variable-resolver/pipeline-variable-resolver-conf.png[]


Here are some examples of expressions and the results they give back:

* `{openvar}conf:db1:username{closevar}` : user1
* `{openvar}conf:db2:db{closevar}` : db2
* `{openvar}conf:db3:port{closevar}` : port3

This gives you a lot of flexibility.

NOTE: In the case that you don't specify any field to retrieve, the whole row will be encoded as a JSON value and given back.
